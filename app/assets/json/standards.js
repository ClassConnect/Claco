Use the two-way table as a sample space to decide if events are independent and to approximate conditional probabilities. <i>For example, collect data from a random sample of students in your school on their favorite subject among math, science, and English. Estimate the probability that a randomly selected student from your school will favor science given that the student is in tenth grade. Do the same for other subjects and compare the results.<\/i><\/div>","category":"Common Core"},{"title":"S-CP.5","label":"<div style='text-align:left;line-height:1.2;padding:7px'><strong> S-CP.5 <\/strong><br \/> Recognize and explain the concepts of conditional probability and independence in everyday language and everyday situations. <i>For example, compare the chance of having lung cancer if you are a smoker with the chance of being a smoker if you have lung cancer.<\/i><\/div>","category":"Common Core"},{"title":"S-CP.6","label":"<div style='text-align:left;line-height:1.2;padding:7px'><strong> S-CP.6 <\/strong><br \/> Find the conditional probability of <i>A<\/i> given <i>B<\/i> as the fraction of <i>B<\/i>&rsquo;s outcomes that also belong to <i>A<\/i>, and interpret the answer in terms of the model.<\/div>","category":"Common Core"},{"title":"S-CP.7","label":"<div style='text-align:left;line-height:1.2;padding:7px'><strong> S-CP.7 <\/strong><br \/> Apply the Addition Rule, P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) &ndash; P(A and B), and interpret the answer in terms of the model.<\/div>","category":"Common Core"},{"title":"S-CP.8","label":"<div style='text-align:left;line-height:1.2;padding:7px'><strong> S-CP.8 <\/strong><br \/> (+) Apply the general Multiplication Rule in a uniform probability model, P(A and B) = P(A)P(B|A) = P(B)P(A|B), and interpret the answer in terms of the model.<\/div>","category":"Common Core"},{"title":"S-CP.9","label":"<div style='text-align:left;line-height:1.2;padding:7px'><strong> S-CP.9 <\/strong><br \/> (+) Use permutations and combinations to compute probabilities of compound events and solve problems.<\/div>","category":"Common Core"},{"title":"S-MD.1","label":"<div style='text-align:left;line-height:1.2;padding:7px'><strong> S-MD.1 <\/strong><br \/> (+) Define a random variable for a quantity of interest by assigning a numerical value to each event in a sample space; graph the corresponding probability distribution using the same graphical displays as for data distributions.<\/div>","category":"Common Core"},{"title":"S-MD.2","label":"<div style='text-align:left;line-height:1.2;padding:7px'><strong> S-MD.2 <\/strong><br \/> (+) Calculate the expected value of a random variable; interpret it as the mean of the probability distribution.<\/div>","category":"Common Core"},{"title":"S-MD.3","label":"<div style='text-align:left;line-height:1.2;padding:7px'><strong> S-MD.3 <\/strong><br \/> (+) Develop a probability distribution for a random variable defined for a sample space in which theoretical probabilities can be calculated; find the expected value. <i>For example, find the theoretical probability distribution for the number of correct answers obtained by guessing on all five questions of a multiple-choice test where each question has four choices, and find the expected grade under various grading schemes.<\/i><\/div>","category":"Common Core"},{"title":"S-MD.4","label":"<div style='text-align:left;line-height:1.2;padding:7px'><strong> S-MD.4 <\/strong><br \/> (+) Develop a probability distribution for a random variable defined for a sample space in which probabilities are assigned empirically; find the expected value. <i>For example, find a current data distribution on the number of TV sets per household in the United States, and calculate the expected number of sets per household.

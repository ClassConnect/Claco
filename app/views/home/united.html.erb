		The problem is that finding the time to create all this incredible content and having the energy to teach it is impossible if we play by the old rules.<br /><br />

		<strong>Technology and the internet have changed the game.</strong> Now, for the first time ever, you can work collaboratively with teachers from around the world to build lessons. This gives you more time & energy to focus on what you do best â€” teaching and inspiring your students. The ideas you contribute will also help thousands of teachers and immediately impact the education of students around the world.<br /><br />

		Every once in a while, a group of pioneers stray from the well-worn path and create the future. This is happening in education <u>right now</u>. Join the tens of thousands of teachers from around the world that are celebrating each other's unique ideas and lets leave education with something really beautiful.

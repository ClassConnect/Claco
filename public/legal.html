3.     When Claco Discloses Information:
<br />

<br />
-      Claco does not share your personally identifiable information with other organizations for their marketing or promotional uses without your prior express consent.  Please be aware, however, that any personally identifiable information that you voluntarily choose to display on the Claco Platform such as when you publish attribution credits for documents or profile information becomes publicly available and may be collected and used by others without restriction.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
-      Claco also reserves the right to disclose User information that we believe, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary: to take precautions against liability; to protect Claco from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses; to investigate and defend ourselves against third-party claims or allegations; to assist government enforcement agencies; to protect the security or integrity of the Claco Platform; or to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Claco, our Users, or others.

<br />

<br />
4.     Your Choices:
<br />

<br />
You may, of course, decline to share your personally-identifiable information with Claco, in which case Claco will not be able to provide to you some of the features and functionality found on the Claco Platform.  You may update, correct, or delete your user information and preferences at any time by following the directions here. 
<br />

<br />
To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting you account access or making corrections to your information.  You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information at all times.

<br />

<br />
Claco uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information.

<br />
Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important.  For that reason, Claco does not knowingly collect or maintain personally identifiable information from persons under 13 years-of-age.  If Claco learns that personally-identifiable information of persons less than 13-years-of-age has been collected on or through the Claco Platform, then Claco will take the appropriate steps to delete this information.
<br />

<br />
If you are the parent or legal guardian of a child under 13 who has become Claco Platform member, then please contact Claco at privacy@claco.com to have that child's account terminated and information deleted.
<br />
